## Implementation Details

### Development Methodology

#### Agile Development Approach
**Sprint Structure**: 2-week sprints with defined deliverables
**Sprint 1-2**: Project setup, basic authentication, user management
**Sprint 3-4**: Enterprise and department management
**Sprint 5-6**: Roster creation and shift management
**Sprint 7-8**: Notification system and real-time features
**Sprint 9-10**: Analytics, testing, and deployment

#### Version Control Strategy
**Git Workflow**: Feature branch workflow with pull requests
**Branching Strategy**: main → develop → feature branches
**Commit Standards**: Conventional commits for automated changelog

### Key Implementation Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
**Problem**: Ensuring complete data separation between enterprises
**Solution**:
- Implemented enterprise_id foreign key in all relevant tables
- Created middleware to automatically filter queries by enterprise
- Added database constraints to prevent cross-enterprise data access

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// Middleware for enterprise isolation
const checkEnterpriseAccess = (req, res, next) => {
  const enterpriseId = parseInt(req.params.enterpriseId);
  if (req.user.enterprise_id !== enterpriseId && req.user.role !== 'systemAdmin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
  }
  next();
};
```

#### Challenge 2: Real-Time Notification System
**Problem**: Delivering instant notifications to relevant users
**Solution**:
- Implemented WebSocket connections with Socket.IO
- Created room-based broadcasting (user, department, enterprise levels)
- Developed fallback email system for offline users

**Architecture**:
```javascript
// WebSocket room management
socket.join(`user_${userId}`);
socket.join(`department_${departmentId}`);
socket.join(`enterprise_${enterpriseId}`);

// Targeted notification broadcasting
io.to(`department_${departmentId}`).emit('roster_published', data);
```

#### Challenge 3: Intelligent Shift Assignment
**Problem**: Fairly distributing shifts while meeting requirements
**Solution**:
- Developed multiple assignment strategies (balanced, random, preference-based)
- Implemented constraint checking (availability, skills, workload limits)
- Created conflict detection and resolution algorithms

**Algorithm Overview**:
```javascript
// Balanced assignment algorithm
const assignShiftsBalanced = (shifts, employees) => {
  // Sort employees by current workload (ascending)
  const sortedEmployees = employees.sort((a, b) => a.currentHours - b.currentHours);

  shifts.forEach(shift => {
    const availableEmployees = sortedEmployees.filter(emp =>
      isAvailable(emp, shift) && hasRequiredSkills(emp, shift)
    );

    if (availableEmployees.length > 0) {
      assignShift(shift, availableEmployees[0]);
      availableEmployees[0].currentHours += shift.duration;
    }
  });
};
```

### Database Design Decisions

#### Schema Design
**Normalization**: 3NF normalization to reduce redundancy
**Indexing Strategy**: Strategic indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
**JSON Fields**: Used JSONB for flexible settings and metadata storage

#### Key Tables and Relationships
```sql
-- Core entity relationships
enterprises (1) → (many) departments
departments (1) → (many) users
departments (1) → (many) rosters
rosters (1) → (many) shifts
shifts (1) → (many) shift_assignments
users (1) → (many) shift_assignments

-- Notification system
users (1) → (many) notifications
users (1) → (one) notification_preferences
```

### Frontend Implementation Highlights

#### Component Architecture
**Atomic Design Principles**: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
**Reusable Components**: Button, Input, Modal, Calendar, DataTable
**Smart vs Dumb Components**: Container components handle logic, presentational components handle UI

#### State Management
**Pinia Stores**: Modular stores for auth, notifications, theme
**Reactive State**: Vue 3 reactivity system for real-time updates
**Persistence**: localStorage for user preferences and session data

#### Responsive Design
**Mobile-First Approach**: Designed for mobile, enhanced for desktop
**Breakpoint Strategy**: Tailwind's responsive utilities
**Touch Interactions**: Optimized for touch devices

### Backend Implementation Highlights

#### API Design
**RESTful Principles**: Resource-based URLs, proper HTTP methods
